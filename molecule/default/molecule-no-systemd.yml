# This molecule configuration file is suitable for testing Ansible
# roles that _do not_ require SystemD.  If your Ansible role _does_
# require SystemD then you should use molecule-with-systemd.yml
# instead.
#
# Note that the molecule configuration file that is symlinked to
# molecule.yml is the one that will be used.

        # auto_legacy is still the default behavior until Ansible 2.12
        # is released, but Molecule overrides this and forces the use
        # of auto.
        #
        # In auto_legacy mode Ansible will prefer the /usr/bin/python
        # interpreter if it exists, while in auto mode it will prefer
        # the Python interpreter specified in an internal map.  In
        # most cases we only have Python3 installed, and the internal
        # map specifies /usr/bin/python3, so it is immaterial whether
        # we use auto_legacy or auto.
        #
        # The one place where it _does_ matter is our Debian9 AKA CyHy
        # instances.  Here the /usr/bin/python _and_ /usr/bin/python3
        # interpreters are both installed.  In Ansible 2.10 a Debian
        # entry was added to the internal map, so now auto_legacy
        # selects the /usr/bin/python interpreter while auto selects
        # the /usr/bin/python3 interpreter.  We want to maintain the
        # auto_legacy behavior in this case since CyHy is still
        # Python2.
