# With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
# identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
# OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
# Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
# 2.10 or newer.
ansible>=2.10,<3
# ansible-lint has a number of breaking changes with the update to v5 as we have
# documented in https://github.com/cisagov/skeleton-ansible-role/issues/69
# We can unpin once everything with the v5 update has shaken out and we have a
# clear path forward.
